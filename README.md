A simple, visually appealing To Do List app styled like a clipboard. Add, check off, edit, and delete your daily tasks with a clean, modern interface.

*FEATURES Add Tasks: Quickly add new tasks to your list. Mark as Done: Check off tasks when completed; done tasks appear faded. Edit Tasks: Double-click a task to edit its name (unless it’s marked as done). Delete Tasks: Remove tasks with a single click on the trash icon. Clipboard Design: The app looks like a real clipboard with a paper sheet and a clip.
